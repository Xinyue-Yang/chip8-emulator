# Introduction
Chip-8 is a programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. These computers typically used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input. The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller.

The project implemented a virtual machine that can run classic chip8 games, such as PONG and PACMAN. In order to run the virtual machine, please first download SDL2.
